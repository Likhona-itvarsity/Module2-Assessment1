                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p>The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.[23] The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda.

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Panda at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
