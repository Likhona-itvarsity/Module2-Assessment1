                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa.
     It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.
     Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.</p>
     <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, 
    its horn-like ossicones,and its geometric coat patterns.</p>
    <p> Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016
    indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Only in Sub-Saharan Africa</p>
