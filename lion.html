                            <h3>LION</h3>
    <p>Lions are majestic creatures that are native to Africa and India. They are the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Lions have a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of their tail. Adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. Lions are social animals that form groups called prides. A lionâ€™s pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. </p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Lions at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
